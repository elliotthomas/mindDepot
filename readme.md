MIND Depot
----------------------------------------------
Mind Depot is a full-stack web application to catalog text passages and accelerate the process of memorizing them by rote. Mind Depot allows the user to input and save any passage from Shakespeare to a favorite quote or speech.

Mind Depot includes features to accelerate the memorization process:

Word by Word’ feature displays the passage word by word
Line by Line’ feature displays the passage line by line
Scroll’ feature uses an interactive scroll bar to add or delete text
Recite’ feature tracks the number of times the passage has been recited aloud by incrementing a counter button.
The ‘Write’ feature allows the user to input text without seeing the original text and compare the two.

‘The Depot’ stores all the passages that the user memorizes by rote. The user is able to browse through all the passages in ‘The Depot.’ Mind Depot is intended for mobile use, so the user can practice whenever a cellular device is present.
